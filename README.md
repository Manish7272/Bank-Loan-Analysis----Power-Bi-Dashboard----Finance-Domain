# Project Overview:
- This project analyzes loan trends, regional patterns, and the impact of employment duration on loans. It also distinguishes between good and bad loans. 
- The dataset includes detailed loan information for 2021, with 38,576 rows and 24 columns.
- Our goal is to enable data-driven decision-making for loan approvals and risk assessment. By developing a comprehensive reporting system and identifying key performance indicators, we aim to provide insights that will optimize the loan approval process and minimize risks.


# KPI's:
- Total Loan Applications:
  - Compute the total number of loan applications received during a specific time period. Monitor changes on a month-to-date (MTD) and month-over-month (MoM) basis.

- Total Funded Amount:
  - Comprehend the total amount of funds disbursed as loans. Illustrate MTD and MoM changes.

- Total Amount Received: Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess the bank's cash flow from repayments. Analyze MTD and MoM changes.

- Average Interest Rate:
  - Calculate the average interest rate across all loans. Monitor MTD and MoM variations to gain insights into the overall cost of the lending portfolio.

- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):
  - Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers to gauge their financial health. Compute average DTI for all loans and analyze MTD and MoM changes.

  
# Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs:
- Good Loan Application Percentage: Calculate the percentage of loan applications classified as good loans. This category encompasses loans with a fully paid status.
- Good Loan Applications: Identify the total number of good loan applications.
- Good Loan Funded Amount: Calculate the total funded amount in the good loan category.
- Good Loan Total Received Amount: Identify the total received amount in the good loan category.
- Bad Loan Application Percentage: Calculate the total bad loan percentage. This category encompasses charged-off loan status.
- Bad Loan Applications: Identify the total number of bad loan applications.
- Bad Loan Funded Amount: Identify the total bad loan funded amount.
- Bad Loan Received Amount: Identify the total received amount via the bad loan category.


### Dashboard Overview 
The dashboard will present crucial loan-related metrics and trends using various chart types to provide a clear and insightful view of lending operations.

- Monthly Trends by Total Applications : Use a line chart to visualize monthly trends in total loan applications.

- Loan Term-Based Analysis: Use a donut chart to depict the proportion of short-term (36 months) and long-term (60 months) loans.
- Funded Loan by Employee Length: Use a bar chart to demonstrate the total funded loan amount by employee length.
- Total Aoan Amount by Purpose: Use a column chart to illustrate the total funded amount by purpose.
